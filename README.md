# KindleResurfacer
A short python app that takes the clippings.txt from an Amazon Kindle and will email you a daily random selection of previously highlighted snippet of a book

This was my first ever working Python app that I programmed, it likely stil works but it is by no means optimised or written in any sort of logical way - I may revisit this at some point as it is a good idea, 

Please note it was also written to be used on a service such as PythonAnywhere and thus does not contain the code to schedule emails. To do this I originally I created a loop that would execute the send code and then wait for 24 hours - again probably not the most ideal way to get around this.
